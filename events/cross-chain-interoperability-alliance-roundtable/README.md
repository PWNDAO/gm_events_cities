name: Cross-Chain Interoperability Alliance Roundtable

synopsis:

  - Who should come

  - ​You are a builder or core contributor in the cross-chain space (e.g bridge, oracle, DeFi protocol, L2). You want to collaborate with other key players in the space to identify the most important problems to solve and common standards and solutions that will collectively benefit all ecosystem players and users. This is your chance to put forward a proposal and get feedback from the cross-chain community.

​
  - Event Format

​  - The event will follow a "roundtable" format, emphasizing interactive discussions rather than formal presentations. Expect interactive sessions involving whiteboarding, where participants can share, refine, and discuss ideas collaboratively.
