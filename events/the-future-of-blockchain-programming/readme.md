# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.berlin/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

synopsis:
  - Welcome onboard! We're thrilled to introduce you to PREDA, a revolutionary programming model designed to scale out general smart contracts. This virtual hackathon is tailored for blockchain builders, developers, entrepreneurs, and anyone eager to supercharge the scalability of their DApps and protocols, harnessing the power of PREDA.
  - By participating in this event, you'll get your hands on powerful tools, dive into the latest technology sharing, and receive wholehearted support from experts who know the ins and outs of programming with PREDA. Beyond that, there's a chance for you to snatch a piece of the 10K USDT reward pie, register for the hackathon now to secure a spot, and be part of this evolution!
  - About PREDA - PREDA is a novel programming model for scaling out any general smart contract. This is achieved by partitioning the smart contract state and dividing the transaction traffic, which are jointly handled by multiple independent virtual machines that can be distributed and parallelized. We implemented the PREDA model by extending the Solidity language, which demonstrates that popular smart contracts with different levels of complexity can be rewritten to gain scalability without taking care of the details of the underlying distributed system.
