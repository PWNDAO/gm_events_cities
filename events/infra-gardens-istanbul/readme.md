# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.berlin/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

  - As one of Europe’s central blockchain conferences unfolds, we provide a timeout and refuge in one of the most beautiful spots in Istanbul. Asli Tunca is a beautiful green oasis in the heart of town, beyond the buzz and noise of the city.

  - Why Infra Gardens?​ Infrastructure is the connecting tissue of the web3 technology stack, serving and enabling different ecosystems, providing the rails and tools for L1s and L2s to attract innovation and equipping builders to develop new primitives and applications.​ Infra Gardens assembles four cross-chain, web3 infrastructure projects to host a diverse crowd from L1s and L2s, DeFi and NFTfi projects, communities, and more to network, educate, and drive the conversation about how they can support their goals.​
